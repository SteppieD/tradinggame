# 🚀 Complete Trading System Guide

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. **Technical Analysis with Fibonacci** 
- Fibonacci retracement levels for support/resistance
- Moving averages (20, 50, 200-day) with Golden/Death Cross detection
- RSI for overbought/oversold conditions
- Bollinger Bands for volatility analysis
- Volume profile analysis

### 2. **Trade Recording System**
- Record actual executions with exact prices and times
- Compare executions with planned orders
- Track slippage and execution quality
- Automatic portfolio updates

## 📊 Daily Workflow

### Morning (Pre-Market)
```bash
# Run complete morning routine
python scripts/daily_run.py morning
```
This will:
- Screen stocks with technical analysis
- Calculate Fibonacci levels
- Check congressional trades
- Generate orders with timing

### Recording Executed Trades

#### Method 1: Quick Add (Single Trade)
```bash
python scripts/trade_recorder.py add SNDL BUY 49 2.01 "09:35 AM"
```

#### Method 2: Interactive Entry (Multiple Trades)
```bash
python scripts/trade_recorder.py
# Follow prompts to enter multiple trades
```

#### Method 3: Import from CSV
Create a CSV file with columns: symbol, action, quantity, price, time
```bash
python scripts/trade_recorder.py import trades.csv
```

### End of Day
```bash
# Run EOD routine
python scripts/daily_run.py eod

# View execution comparison
python scripts/trade_recorder.py summary
```

## 🎯 Technical Indicators

### Fibonacci Levels
The system automatically calculates:
- **Key Levels**: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%
- **Support**: Nearest Fibonacci level below current price
- **Resistance**: Nearest Fibonacci level above current price
- **Position Strength**: 0-100% (where you are between support/resistance)

### Trading Signals
```python
# Run technical analysis on any symbol
python -c "from technical_analysis import TechnicalAnalyzer; 
ta = TechnicalAnalyzer(); 
print(ta.generate_technical_signals('AAPL'))"
```

### Signal Meanings
- **STRONG_BUY**: Multiple indicators align bullish + near Fibonacci support
- **BUY**: Bullish signals but not at key support
- **NEUTRAL**: Mixed signals
- **SELL**: Bearish signals but not at resistance
- **STRONG_SELL**: Multiple bearish + at Fibonacci resistance
