# ðŸ“‹ SUPER SIMPLE: Just Paste Your Trades to Claude Code!

## Option 1: Direct to Claude Code (Easiest!)

Just tell me in natural language:

> "I bought 50 shares of AAPL at $150.25 and sold 20 shares of TSLA at $800"

Or paste from your broker:

> "Here are my trades:
> Filled Buy 50 AAPL @ $150.25 at 09:35 AM
> Filled Sell 20 TSLA @ $800.00 at 10:45 AM"

**I'll automatically parse and record them for you!**

## Option 2: Use the PASTE_TRADES_HERE.py File

1. Open `PASTE_TRADES_HERE.py`
2. Paste your trades between the triple quotes
3. Run: `python PASTE_TRADES_HERE.py`

## Option 3: Command Line

```bash
python scripts/trade_parser.py
# Then paste your trades and press Enter twice
```
