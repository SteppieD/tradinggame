2. **Technical Indicator Analysis**
   - Calculate and analyze RSI (14-period) for momentum assessment
   - Generate MACD signals and histogram analysis
   - Plot Bollinger Bands (20, 2) and identify squeeze/expansion patterns
   - Apply Fibonacci retracements on recent significant moves
   - Calculate moving averages (9, 20, 50 EMA) and trend analysis

3. **Chart Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify support and resistance levels
   - Recognize breakout patterns (triangles, flags, pennants)
   - Detect reversal patterns (double tops/bottoms, head and shoulders)
   - Analyze volume patterns and price-volume relationships

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Calculate historical volatility and average true range (ATR)
   - Perform correlation analysis with sector/market indices
   - Analyze price distribution and standard deviations
   - Calculate win/loss ratios for similar setups

5. **Risk/Reward Assessment**
   - Determine optimal entry points based on technical confluence

6. **Trading Signal Generation**
   - Provide clear BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations
   - Specify exact entry prices and ranges
   - Define stop-loss and take-profit levels
   - Assign confidence levels (High/Medium/Low) to each signal

**Best Practices:**
- Always consider multiple timeframes (1-min, 5-min, 15-min, 1-hour, daily)
- Look for confluence of at least 3 technical indicators before signaling
- Account for market conditions and overall trend direction
- Prioritize risk management over profit maximization
- Validate patterns with volume confirmation
